# 📘 Mastering OOP in C++: From Basics to File Handling & Bitwise Analysis

A comprehensive C++ project demonstrating **core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts through practical, real-world examples. This project includes everything from abstraction and encapsulation to file I/O and bitwise operations — all organized in a single file for easy understanding and usage.

## 📦 Features

OOP Fundamentals: Class, Object, Abstraction, Encapsulation
🔹 Access Modifiers: private, protected, public
🔹 Inheritance and Polymorphism
🔹 Static Members and the this Pointer
🔹 Constructor and Destructor
🔹 Constructor Overloading and Method Overloading
🔹 Operator Overloading (e.g., + for Complex numbers)
🔹 Exception Handling (e.g., divide-by-zero)
🔹 File Input/Output using Student Records
🔹 Bitwise Analysis Tool (binary conversion, 1s and 0s ratio)







## 🚀 How to Run

Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (like `g++`):


g++ -o main main.cpp
./main

# 🧠 C++ OOP Educational Programs

This project contains a collection of C++ programs to demonstrate **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts and other advanced techniques like file handling, exception handling, and bitwise operations.

---

## 🔷 1. Employee Management System

**Concepts Covered**:  
✔ Abstraction  
✔ Encapsulation  
✔ Inheritance  
✔ Polymorphism  
✔ Access Modifiers  

**Classes**:  
- `Employee` (Base class)  
- `Developer`, `Manager` (Derived classes)  

Each class demonstrates how access modifiers, virtual functions, and method overriding are used in real scenarios.

---

## 🔷 2. Static Variables & `this` Pointer

**Concepts Covered**:  
✔ `static` data members  
✔ `this` keyword  

**Class**:  
- `Counter`: Tracks the number of created objects using a static variable.

---

## 🔷 3. Operator Overloading

**Concepts Covered**:  
✔ Operator Overloading  

**Class**:  
- `Complex`: Overloads the `+` operator to add two complex numbers.

---

## 🔷 4. Exception Handling

**Concepts Covered**:  
✔ try-catch blocks  
✔ throwing exceptions  

**Function**:  
- `divide(int a, int b)`: Demonstrates division with runtime error check for divide-by-zero.

---

## 🔷 5. Student Data Management (File I/O)

**Concepts Covered**:  
✔ File reading and writing  
✔ Object storage in text files  

**Class**:  
- `Student`: Saves and retrieves student information to/from a file.

---

## 🔷 6. Bitwise Analysis

**Concepts Covered**:  
✔ Binary conversion  
✔ Counting 1s and 0s in a number  
✔ Percentage analysis  

**Class**:  
- `BitAnalyzer`: Analyzes a number’s binary form, counts bits, and calculates ratios.

## 🔄 How to Use

1. Compile the program:
```bash
g++ oop_master.cpp -o oop_program
```

2. Run the program:
```bash
./oop_program
```

3. Follow the prompts for each part.

## 📚 What You’ll Learn

- Real-world application of OOP in C++
- Proper class design using abstraction and encapsulation
- Using polymorphism with virtual functions
- Managing resources with constructors/destructors
- Working with file streams
- Handling runtime errors gracefully
- Using bit-level operations in practical use-cases
