# 📘 Mastering OOP in C++: From Basics to File Handling & Bitwise Analysis

A comprehensive C++ project demonstrating **core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts through practical, real-world examples. This project includes everything from abstraction and encapsulation to file I/O and bitwise operations — all organized in a single file for easy understanding and usage.

## 📦 Features

OOP Fundamentals: Class, Object, Abstraction, Encapsulation
🔹 Access Modifiers: private, protected, public
🔹 Inheritance and Polymorphism
🔹 Static Members and the this Pointer
🔹 Constructor and Destructor
🔹 Constructor Overloading and Method Overloading
🔹 Operator Overloading (e.g., + for Complex numbers)
🔹 Exception Handling (e.g., divide-by-zero)
🔹 File Input/Output using Student Records
🔹 Bitwise Analysis Tool (binary conversion, 1s and 0s ratio)







## 🚀 How to Run

Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (like `g++`):


g++ -o main main.cpp
./main
